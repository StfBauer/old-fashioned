# VS Code Extension Test Suite Cleanup

## Summary
The VS Code Old Fashioned extension's test suite has been reorganized and fixed to address TypeScript errors and improve test structure. The primary focus was on consolidating the multiple overlapping test files and fixing TypeScript errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Errors
- Fixed TypeScript type errors in test files
- Fixed incorrect import statements
- Fixed issues with VS Code API mocking

### 2. Consolidated Test Files
- Merged functionality from multiple test files:
  - extension.test.ts
  - extension-fixed.test.ts
  - extension-improved.test.ts
  - config-integration.test.ts (and variants)
- Created cleaner test files with proper structure

### 3. Mocking Improvements
- Used vi.hoisted() for proper mock initialization order
- Fixed VS Code mocking strategy to avoid circular dependencies
- Improved mock implementation for configuration

## Test Organization
The consolidated test files follow a clear organization:

### Extension Tests
- **Extension Activation**
  - Command registration
  - Provider registration
  - Activation messages

- **CSS Property Sorting**
  - Error handling
  - CSS sorting logic
  - Progress indication

- **Utility Functions**
  - Parse syntax
  - Configuration options
  - Diagnostics

### Configuration Integration Tests
- Project-level configuration detection
- VS Code settings integration
- Config fallback behavior
- Error handling

## Remaining Work
Some tests still fail due to implementation details rather than test structure issues:

1. **Mock Configuration Issues**
   - Some tests need refinement of the mock implementation

2. **Function Call Expectations**
   - Some tests expect certain functions to be called but they aren't in the implementation

## Next Steps
1. Evaluate whether the implementation or tests need adjustment
2. Further streamline the test suite by removing redundant files
3. Improve test coverage for edge cases

These improvements provide a more maintainable test suite that will be easier to extend as the extension evolves.
