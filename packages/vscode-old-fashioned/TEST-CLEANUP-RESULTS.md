# Test Cleanup Results

## Overview of Changes Made
1. Fixed the TypeScript syntax errors in the test files
2. Consolidated the multiple test files into cleaner versions
3. Improved the mocking approach using vi.hoisted() for proper initialization order
4. Fixed issues with VS Code configuration mocking

## Current Test Status
After applying the fixes, we've seen significant improvement in the TypeScript compiler errors, but some tests are still failing at runtime due to implementation issues:

### Fixed Issues
- Removed TypeScript compiler errors from the test files
- Proper mocking structure and initialization
- Better organization of test cases

### Remaining Issues
- Some implementation-specific failures are still occurring:
  - The workspace.getConfiguration().get mock implementation needs refinement
  - Some tests are expecting mock functions to be called but they aren't
  - Integration tests with the filesystem need better setup

## Next Steps
1. Complete mocking configuration issues
   - Ensure the `get` method on configuration objects works correctly
   - Fix the mock strategy for `withProgress` and `stylelint.lint`

2. Fix test expectations or implementation
   - Update test expectations to match actual behavior if necessary
   - Fix implementation to match expected behavior in tests

3. Consider further test cleanup
   - Remove redundant test files once consolidated versions are working
   - Add proper error handling in tests

## Benefits of the Consolidated Approach
- More maintainable test structure
- Clearer separation between test groups
- More consistent mocking approach
- Better TypeScript type safety

The consolidated tests now have a much cleaner structure and should provide a better foundation for ongoing development.
