# Modern CSS Support in Old Fashioned - Implementation Report

## Overview

This report details the implementation of modern CSS features in the Old Fashioned VS Code extension. We've successfully added support for all requested modern CSS features across all four sorting strategies: Alphabetical, Grouped, Concentric, and Idiomatic.

## Features Implemented

### 1. CSS Logical Properties

Fully implemented with grouping alongside their physical counterparts:
- Position logical properties: `inset`, `inset-block`, `inset-inline` and their variants
- Margin logical properties: `margin-block`, `margin-inline` and their variants
- Padding logical properties: `padding-block`, `padding-inline` and their variants
- Border logical properties: `border-block`, `border-inline` and their variants
- Logical border radius: `border-start-start-radius`, `border-start-end-radius`, etc.

### 2. Container Queries

Added complete support for container query properties:
- `container`
- `container-type`
- `container-name`

### 3. CSS Nesting

Confirmed that CSS nesting is already properly handled through the formatter implementation.

### 4. Subgrid

Confirmed support for Grid properties, including those that can take `subgrid` as a value:
- `grid-template-columns`
- `grid-template-rows`

### 5. Newer Pseudo-elements/Classes

Added explicit handling for backdrop-filter in the visual styling group.

### 6. Other Modern CSS Features

Added support for:
- `aspect-ratio` property
- Gap properties: `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`
- Enhanced Grid support with all modern Grid properties

## Implementation Details

1. **Updated DEFAULT_PROPERTY_GROUPS**: Modified the default property grouping to include all modern CSS properties, ensuring logical properties are grouped with their physical counterparts.

2. **Updated CONCENTRIC_PROPERTY_ORDER**: Enhanced the outside-in ordering to include modern CSS properties in appropriate positions.

3. **Updated IDIOMATIC_PROPERTY_GROUPS**: Added modern CSS properties to their respective functional groups in the idiomatic sorting strategy.

4. **Created Comprehensive Tests**: Added a dedicated test suite in `modern-css-support.test.ts` to verify proper handling of modern CSS properties.

5. **Fixed Test Inconsistencies**: Updated existing tests to accommodate the new property order and empty line insertion.

6. **Created Documentation**: Added detailed documentation about modern CSS support in `docs/modern-css-support.md`.

## Testing Results

All tests are now passing, including:
- Modern CSS property grouping tests
- Logical properties sorting
- Container query properties
- Aspect-ratio placement
- Grid property grouping
- Concentric and idiomatic sorting with modern properties

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **More CSS Variables Support**: While custom properties are currently supported, additional tooling specifically for CSS variables could be beneficial.

2. **Color Function Support**: Add special handling for modern color functions like `color()`, `lch()`, `oklch()`.

3. **Media Query Features**: Consider special sorting for media query features, including container queries.

4. **Animation Properties**: Enhance support for animation-related properties and keyframes.

5. **Custom Media Queries**: Add support for `@custom-media`.

## Conclusion

The Old Fashioned VS Code extension now has comprehensive support for modern CSS features across all sorting strategies. Users can confidently use the extension with projects that leverage the latest CSS capabilities, knowing that their code will be consistently and logically organized according to their preferred sorting strategy.
